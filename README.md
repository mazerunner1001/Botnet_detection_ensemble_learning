# üîç Botnet Detection Using Ensemble and Deep Learning

## üìñ Overview
Botnets are one of the most dangerous threats in IoT networks. They hijack connected devices and use them for malicious activities such as DDoS, spam, and data theft. Traditional detection systems often fail to keep up with evolving attack patterns.  

This project explores **ensemble learning and deep learning** methods to build a robust botnet detection system. The goal is to compare classical ML baselines, deep neural architectures (CNN, LSTM), and tuned models to evaluate how well they identify botnet traffic.

## üéØ Objectives
- Preprocess IoT traffic data into a usable format for ML/DL models.  
- Train **classical ML baselines** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) as references.  
- Design **deep learning models** (CNNs, LSTMs) for sequential/temporal pattern detection.  
- Experiment with **hyperparameter tuning** to optimize learning rate and architecture.  
- Compare models on standard metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.  
- Show the advantage of ensemble/deep learning approaches over simple baselines.

## üß© Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Load raw IoT traffic dataset(s).  
   - Scale and encode features for ML/DL readiness.  
   - Split into training/testing sets.  

2. **Baseline Models**  
   - Train simple classifiers like **Logistic Regression**.  
   - Evaluate using ROC-AUC, Accuracy, F1, Precision, Recall.  
   - Establish a baseline performance benchmark.  

3. **Deep Learning Models**  
   - Implement **LSTMs** (to capture sequential temporal dependencies).  
   - Implement **1D CNNs** (to capture local spatial/temporal patterns).  
   - Train models on preprocessed traffic data.  

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Vary learning rates and optimizers (Adam).  
   - Use callbacks like **EarlyStopping** to avoid overfitting.  
   - Compare accuracy vs learning rate using plots.  

5. **Model Comparison**  
   - Compare classical vs. deep vs. tuned models.  
   - Analyze confusion matrices, ROC curves, and metric tradeoffs.  
   - Highlight advantages of ensemble/deep models for IoT botnet detection.
